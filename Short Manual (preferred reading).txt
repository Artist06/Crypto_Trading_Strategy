To : TIC x NJACK x UNTRADE TEAM
We have submitted the drive link which contains 2 subfolders , one for BTC and other one for ETH in which we have uploaded multiple strategies.
For each strategy, we have uploaded 3 files
Input files are taken from the links provided by tic iit patna in their WhatsApp group 
a)ipynb file-->
	Main strategy 
	Naming convention: strategyno.instrument.speciality
	Backtest code
	Shown some working as well but its not clear(preferred to run it on own device(google colab preferred to avoid incompatibility  	issues.)
b)output csv
	csv containing data of long and short positions as per strategy.
c)Explanatory file(optional) 
	contains the actual implementation idea of the strategy and explaination

We hope you will like this .
Below is the data for technical issues handling and understanding and also references.
Special thanks to Zelta Automations for providing this opportunity.
THANKING YOU

Technical Working
1.Libraries and Frameworks
a)Pandas
b)NumPy
c)pandas_ta (!pip install pandas_ta)
d)ta(!pip install ta)
e)matplotlib(optional)

Simply upload the ipynb to colab and run all cells.

2.Handling data frame error 
In case the file is unable to read and showing error 'parse datetime'
use any of the given below 2 codes after loading data in pandas dataframe
code1(preferred)
df['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['datetime'], errors='coerce')
df = df.dropna(subset=['datetime'])
df.set_index('datetime', inplace=True)

code2(may or may not work dataset and system specific)(should try if code1 is not working)
# Parse the 'datetime' column correctly
df['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['datetime'], format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')  # Adjusted format
df.set_index('datetime', inplace=True)


3.Dataset to use (most preferred for specific strategy)
-->this is mentioned while loading the csv to pandas data frame in the usual google colab format ('/content/file_name.csv')
-->file name corresponds to the data used

4.Graph Plot (optional)
use given code and type it after the strategy cell in ipynb file
# Plot equity curve
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
plt.plot(df.index, balance_history, label='Equity Curve', color='blue')
plt.title('Equity Curve')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Balance (USD)')
plt.grid()
plt.legend()
plt.show()
